Delete Tasks: Delete tasks that are no longer needed
Persistent Data: Tasks remain even after refreshing the page, thanks to local storage

How It Works
Add Tasks:
Users can add new tasks by entering text into the input field and clicking the "Add" button.

Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking the checkbox next to each task. Completed tasks are visually distinct, making it easy to see your progress.

Delete Tasks:
If a task is no longer needed, users can delete it by clicking the "Delete" button next to the task.
